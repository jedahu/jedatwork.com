:summary: My new website engine.

http://github.com/jedahu/flog[Flog] is website + blog engine that meets the
following requirements:

- uses http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc[AsciiDoc] for posts and pages,
  including AsciiDoc meta data;
- uses http://pygments.org[Pygments] for code highlighting;
- creates post URLs by ordinal number, not date or title;
- does not mix engine code and site content in the same project;
- generates pages statically, but on-demand (to a cache) rather than ahead of
  time;
- is trivial to deploy to http://heroku.com[Heroku].

This site runs on Flog.
